Updated to be compliant with CB600+
Further Maven Integration and Autobuilding
Better handling of configuration file errors.
If you do not have a world config file for the default world at startup it will now look for config.yml
If it cannot find that it will look for world.yml instead in case you named it that when that is not what is in level-name:
It will rewrite the config file to be the proper name. At this time it does not delete the old one though.
Removed defunct public abstract calls. If your not using the right one by now you should be shot anyway.
